•	Reconnaissance - This process begins with getting to know the target using passive methods and network scanning.

•	Vulnerability Identification – This process identifies valid findings from the scans to further exploit manually for the purpose of detecting security weaknesses   in the application.

•	Exploitation – At this stage the security consultant safely exploits the identified vulnerability to gain access by breaching security of a system. Once, the       access is acquired, the focus turns to escalation and movement to identify technical risk and total business impact.

•	Reporting - Detailing the vulnerabilities found and providing information on potential impact on the company if exploited.
