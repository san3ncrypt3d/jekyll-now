•	**Reconnaissance** - This process begins with getting to know the target using passive methods and network scanning.

•	**Vulnerability Identification** – This process identifies valid findings from the scans to further exploit manually for the purpose of detecting security weaknesses   in the application.

•	**Exploitation** – At this stage the security consultant safely exploits the identified vulnerability to gain access by breaching security of a system. Once, the       access is acquired, the focus turns to escalation and movement to identify technical risk and total business impact.

•	**Reporting** - Detailing the vulnerabilities found and providing information on potential impact on the company if exploited.
