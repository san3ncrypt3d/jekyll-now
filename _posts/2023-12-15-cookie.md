Introduction:

In the world of cybersecurity and penetration testing, extracting critical information like cookies from browsers can be pivotal. During a recent pentest engagement, I encountered a scenario where extracting cookies from Firefox became essential to understanding the security posture of a system.

Scenario:

During a penetration test, I encountered the need to extract cookies from Firefox, a common task in reconnaissance and information gathering. Cookies can contain valuable data, including authentication tokens, session IDs, and user preferences. In this scenario, I required a quick and efficient way to extract these cookies and securely transmit them to a remote server for analysis.

The Script:

To address this requirement swiftly, I developed a simple yet effective script leveraging C# for Windows environments. The script involves interacting with the Firefox browser profile to access the cookies database (cookies.sqlite). By using the SQLite library, it reads the cookie data and prepares it for transmission.

Script Overview:

Initial Setup: The script identifies the Firefox profile directory and connects to the cookies.sqlite database within that profile.
Cookie Retrieval: It queries the database to retrieve the cookies, extracting key-value pairs.
Sending to a Remote Server: It prompts the user for a remote server URL and formats the cookies for transmission. A WebClient is used to send the cookies to the specified server.
Usage:

To use the script, one must execute it within a Windows environment and provide the URL of the remote server where the cookies will be sent. The script automates the retrieval and transmission process, providing a quick solution for obtaining crucial cookie data.

Conclusion:

Quick and dirty scripts can serve as invaluable tools during penetration tests, enabling the efficient extraction of crucial information for security assessment. This script demonstrated the simplicity and effectiveness of leveraging C# to gather and transmit Firefox cookies during a pentest, providing insight into potential vulnerabilities and security weaknesses.
