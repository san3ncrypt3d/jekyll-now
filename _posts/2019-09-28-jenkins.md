This is blog, we will be exploiting jenkins running on Metasploitable3.

What is Jenkins ?

Jenkins is an open source automation server written in Java. Jenkins helps to automate the non-human part of the software development process, with continuous integration and facilitating technical aspects of continuous delivery.

Step 1: you guessed it !!

Nmap search 
```
namp -sV -p- IP
