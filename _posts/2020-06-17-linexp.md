title: linux-explorer - live forensics toolbox for Linux endpoints (Exception: error: YARA not installed solution)
---

![](/images/2020-06-17-linexp/0.png)


Hello guys, The other day I was testing some DFIR tools and I came across this linux live forensic tool called linux-explorer. The reason why I am writing this tutorial is due to the lack of documentation or tutorial out on the internet that helps people with common issues that you might encounter during installation. I spend quite some time trying to find a solution for an issue I encountered and I want to show you guys how I solved it and hopefully this might save you some time.

Linux Explorer is an Easy-to-use live forensics toolbox for Linux endpoints written in Python & Flask. 

The link to the Github repo : [https://github.com/intezer/linux-explorer](https://github.com/intezer/linux-explorer)

This tool can be used to get information from linux such as :
•	 process list
•	Inspect process memory map & fetch memory strings easly
•	Dump process memory in one click
•	Automatically search hash in public services
•	users list
•	syslog
•	auth.log(user authentication log)
•	ufw.log(firewall log)
•	bash history
•	chkrootkit
•	whois

Other capabilities include: 

•	Scan a file or directory using YARA signatures by @Neo23x0
•	Scan a running process memory address space
•	Upload your own YARA signature


##Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/intezer/linux-explorer.git
```

This will clone the repository to your local machine.

Before any installation make sure to install 

1) YARA 
2) Chkrootkit

On an ubuntu machine you can install these by:

```
sudo apt install yara
```

```
sudo apt install chkrootkit
```

Now cd into the repo

```
cd linux-explorer/
```

The repository have a requirement.txt file that specify all python modules needed for this to work, so go ahead and install that by:

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

now start the script by

```
./start_server.sh
```

This script is intended to deploy the linux_explorer.py for you.

So, this is where I encountered an error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "linux_explorer.py", line 21, in
toolbox = dict({'yara': tools.YARA(),
File "/home/linux_expl0rer/tools.py", line 16, in __init__
raise Exception('error: %s not installed' % self.__class__.__name__)
Exception: error: YARA not installed
```

Intresting, I installed YARA but I still got the error. I tried searching to find a solution for this error but eventually after snooping through all clutters I gave and decide to read the source code.

```
class YARA(Tool):
  def _is_installed(self):
    return os.path.isfile('/usr/bin/yara')
    
  def set_cmdline(self, rule_file, dir='/', recursive=True, pid=None):
    if pid:
          self._proc_cmdline = ['/usr/bin/yara', rule_file, pid]
          
    else:
        self._proc_cmdline = ['/usr/bin/yara'] + ['-r',rule_file, dir] if recursive els
        
       
```

so this code is looking for yara at the predefined location /usr/bin/yara.

Lets see where our yara is installed:

```
find / -name yara 2> /dev/null
```

In the result I noticed that yara is installed in:

```
/usr/local/bin/yara
```

Okay !! so now we just have to edit the code to point the correct location in our OS.

Now the source code will look as follow :

```
class YARA(Tool):
  def _is_installed(self):
    return os.path.isfile('/usr/local/bin/yara')
    
  def set_cmdline(self, rule_file, dir='/', recursive=True, pid=None):
    if pid:
          self._proc_cmdline = ['/usr/local/bin/yara', rule_file, pid]
          
    else:
        self._proc_cmdline = ['/usr/local/bin/yara'] + ['-r',rule_file, dir] if recursive els
        
       
```

Now start the script again and it should work and you can navigate to the browser view by:

```
start firefox http://127.0.0.1:8080
```
