Hi Everyone, this post will be a walkthrough of the box “ripper” from Vulnhub.

[Ripper:1]( https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/ripper-1,706/)

Let’s start off with NMAP to find the IP associated with the box.

Alternatively, you can use netdiscover as well:

```
Nmap 10.0.0.0/24
Netdiscover -r 10.0.0.0/24

```

The NMAP scan shows three ports open

Port 1000 – Webmin
Port 80 – RIP scanner
22 -SSH

Visiting the IP says this:

Add “ripper-min” into /etc/hosts

The defaults creds do not work.

After enumerating the directories, we will find that robots.txt exists and there is an interesting entry:


![](/images/2021-6-20-ripper/4.png)

We will decode the base64 value:

This indicates that rips is installed on the server.

RIPS is usually installed on apache or ngnix, so we will enumerate port 80:

The server is using rips 0.55, which have a known vulnerability

Refer: [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39094)

The parameter “file” is vulnerable :

Now we will enumerate files using BURP.

This vulnerability reads php file, so we will use a wordlist to see if we can find anything interesting.

 
This is the error when you use invalid file:

First, insert the payload marker:

![](/images/2021-6-20-ripper/10.png)

Now create a grep rule since we know the error message:

![](/images/2021-6-20-ripper/11.png)

We found out “secret.php” file exist:

![](/images/2021-6-20-ripper/13.png)

We got creds:

Let’s us try to use it to SSH:

![](/images/2021-6-20-ripper/15.png)

User ripper does not have a lot of privileges:

![](/images/2021-6-20-ripper/16.png)

After enumerating, I searched for keywords and found a file with this password:

![](/images/2021-6-20-ripper/17.png)

![](/images/2021-6-20-ripper/18.png)

I tried to use the password on user cubes:
