**FTK Imager (Memory Imaging Tool/ Analyzer)**

![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/1.png)

This is a data preview and imaging tool with which one can study files and folders on a hard drive, network drive, and CDs/DVDs. It allows you to:

1)	review forensic memory dumps or images.
2)	create MD5 or SHA1 file hashes that are already deleted from the recycle bin, if their data blocks have not already been overwritten.
3)	mount forensic images to view their contents in browser.

```
How to use :
1)	download the exe from : [https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-3-2-0](https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-3-2-0 )
2)	run the exe file on the target machine.
```

Comment:

Pros: Creates bit-by-bit image and creates exact replica of the drive, thus allowing the investigator to view deleted or irretrievable files. It also creates a keyword index for every image, which makes future searches easier.

Cons: It doesn’t carve files and lacks recursive export capabilities. 

**Magnet RAM Capture (Memory Imaging Tool)**

Magnet Ram Capture is one of the many tools provided by Magnet Forensics. It is a free tool that captures the physical memory of a computer. This can help forensic investigators recover and analyze useful artifacts in the computer’s memory.

Having a small memory footprint, the tool can be run while the overwritten data in the memory is minimized. The collected memory data can be exported in RAW format and uploaded into any of the forensic analysis tools.

The tool collects: 

1)	 processes and programs
2)	 network connections
3)	 registry hives
4)	 malware intrusion evidence
5)	 decrypted keys and files
6)	 usernames and passwords
7)	any other activity not usually stored on the hard disk.
```
How to use:
1)	Download the exe file from: [https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-ram-capture/](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-ram-capture/)

Supported Platforms:
![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/8.png)

collector option:

This option will create a folder which can be used for audit purpose of a victim machine in which malware(artifact) is running. This will create RunRedlineAudit.bat, which will collect necessary information that can be audited by redline. We just to create a folder on the machine where Redline is running using collector option where it will create the bat file. We have to take that batch file either by USB or shared network folder to the victim machine.

Investigation using Redline Memory Analyzer option

Use an image file from a tool such a memoryze to create an image and use this tool to analyze the image.
After taking the image, we will analyze using Redline for further investigation. First, we will place the image into Redline: choose IOC. For IOC, you first have to download it from FireEye.

**Bulk_extractor**

bulk_extractor is a computer forensics tool that scans a disk image, a file, or a directory of files and extracts useful information without parsing the file system structure.
Using this approach, bulk_extractor is more fast than other forensic tools and can process different parts of the disk in parallel, splitting the disk up into 16MiByte pages and processes one page on each available core.

Furthermore, bulk_extractor can be used to process any digital media, like hard drives, SSDs, optical media, camera cards, cell phones, network packet dumps, and other kinds of digital information.

bulk_extractor can extract a lot of informations:

●	Credit card numbers
●	Credit card “track 2″ information
●	Internet domains found on the drive, including dotted-quad addresses found in text.
●	Email addresses
●	Ethernet MAC addresses found through IP packet carving of swap files and compressed system hibernation files and file fragments.
●	EXIFs from JPEGs and video segments.
●	Results of specific regular expression search requests.
●	IP addresses found through IP packet carving.
●	US and international telephone numbers.
●	URLs, typically found in browser caches, email messages, and pre-compiled into executables.
●	A histogram of terms used in Internet searches from services such as Google, Bing, Yahoo, and others.
●	A list of all “words” extracted from the disk, useful for password cracking.
●	A list of every ZIP file component found on the media.


How to use:

1)	Download it from the github: [https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor)
2)	Clone the repo in ubuntu

4)	Install the configuration according to the OS (./configure)
5)	bulk_extractor -o bulk-ex sample.img – This will analyze the image the output onto a folder


Comment: Easier to run on kali linux 


**Kape**

Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor (KAPE) is primarily a triage program that will target a device or storage location, find the most forensically relevant artifacts (based on your needs), and parse them within a few minutes. Because of its speed, KAPE allows investigators to find and prioritize the more critical systems to their case. Additionally, KAPE can be used to collect the most critical artifacts prior to the start of the imaging process. While the imaging completes, the data generated by KAPE can be reviewed for leads, building timelines, etc.

How to use:

```
1)	Download the executables into target machine : [https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/investigate-and-respond/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/investigate-and-respond/kroll-artifact-parser-extractor-kape)
2)	 Use PowerShell as admin to navigate to the downloaded directory 
```

![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/17.png)

While there are quite a few options, things are generally broken down into two main categories: Targets and Modules.

Target options start with 't' and module options start with 'm' and are grouped together as shown above.
●	For targets, --tsource,-- tdest, and --target are all required.
●	For modules, --msource, --mdest, and --module are required



Comment: KAPE is a command line tool and it is fast. It copied about 700 files in under a second

**Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer**

Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer is a tiny free forensic tool that allows to reliably extract the entire contents of computer’s volatile memory – even if protected by an active anti-debugging or anti-dumping system. Separate 32-bit and 64-bit builds are available in order to minimize the tool’s footprint as much as possible. Memory dumps captured with Belkasoft Live RAM Capturer can be analyzed with Live RAM Analysis in Belkasoft Evidence Center.

It’s important to note that Live RAM Capturer complies all the forensic requirements of memory capturing: it operates in kernel mode, leaves the smallest footprint possible, it’s portable and uses read-only access.

**Belkasoft Acquisition Tool**

Belkasoft Acquisition Tool helps investigators to complete one of the most important steps of investigation: obtaining data from a data source. Four types of data sources are currently supported:

●	Hard or removable drives
●	Mobile devices
●	Computer RAM memory
●	Cloud data
The acquired image can be then analyzed with Belkasoft Evidence Center or any third-party tool.

**Dshell**

The framework handles stream reassembly of both IPv4 and IPv6 network traffic and also includes geolocation and IP-to-ASN mapping data for each connection.  The framework also enables development of network analysis plug-ins that are designed to aid in the understanding of network traffic and present results to the user in a concise, useful manner by allowing users to parse and present data of interest from multiple levels of the network stack.  Since Dshell is written entirely in Python, the entire code base can be customized to particular problems quickly and easily; from tweaking an existing decoder to extract slightly different information from existing protocols, to writing a new parser for a completely novel protocol.  

How to use: 

1)	Install the dependencies required: sudo pip install geoip2 pycrypto dpkt IPy pypcap
2)	Run “make” -  This will build Dshell.
3)	Run ./dshell.

![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/19.png)
decode -l : This will list all available decoders alongside basic information about them
decode -h : Show generic command-line flags available to most decoders
decode -d <decoder> : Display information about a decoder, including available command-line flags
decode -d <decoder> <pcap> : Run the selected decoder on a pcap file

Features:

●	Robust stream reassembly
●	IPv4 and IPv6 support
●	Custom output handlers
●	Chainable decoders

Comment: Good at analyzing network packets.


**Scot**

![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/20.png)


SCOT is a cyber security incident response (IR) management system designed by cyber security incident responders to provide a new approach for managing security alerts.

SCOT's ease of use eliminated the steep learning curve of traditional SIEMS and captured team knowledge much more effectively. Designed for cyber security, SCOT allows the IR team to enter data easily, instead of struggling to conform to a ticketing system designed for other purposes. While workflow systems handle linear workflows easily, SCOT is purpose built for the looping nature of cyber security investigations. SCOT also solves the challenges of keeping wikis, spreadsheets and documents up-to-date and accessible to an IR team.

Guide: [https://scot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html](https://scot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html)

Solution: Clear cache or hard restart the browser.


Comment: This tool provides a similar functionality as SIEM. Installation take a long time and troubleshooting can be quite difficult.

**MIG**

MIG provides a platform to perform investigative analysis on remote systems. By using the right queries, information can be obtained from these systems. This all happens in parallel, making intrusion detection, investigation, and follow-up easier.

How it works

MIG uses a client-server model and communicates via AMQP. By using custom queries or pre-defined JSON files (playbooks), all endpoints can be queried. All communications are encrypted or signed, to decrease the chance of a malicious actor abusing the platform.

![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/24.png)
How to use:

1)	 docker pull mozilla/mig
2)	 docker run -it mozilla/mig


Comment: The container is not suitable for production use but lets you experiment with MIG quickly, providing a single container environment that has most of the MIG components available.


**OSQUERY**

osquery exposes an operating system as a high-performance relational database. This allows you to write SQL-based queries to explore operating system data. With osquery, SQL tables represent abstract concepts such as running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections, browser plugins, hardware events or file hashes.

How to install:

1)	Download from : https://osquery.io/downloads
2)	Navigate to the installed directory using CMD
3)	Execute osquery.exe

![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/25.png)
![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/26.png)

Comment: This tool makes it super easy to query. However, user must have understating of syntax of SQL queries in order to work with this tool. 

**Crowd Strike**

CrowdResponse is a lightweight console application that can be used as part of an incident response scenario to gather contextual information such as a process list, scheduled tasks, or Shim Cache. Using embedded YARA signatures you can also scan your host for malware and report if there are any indicators of compromise.

How to install:

1)	Download the zip file from:
[https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/community-tools/crowdresponse/](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/community-tools/crowdresponse/)

2)	extract the ZIP file and launch a Command Prompt with Administrative Privileges

Additional usage information:

Navigate to the folder where the CrowdResponse*.exe process resides and enter your command parameters. At minimum, you must include the output path and the ‘tool’ you wish to use to collect data. For a full list of ‘tools’, enter CrowdResponse64.exe in the command prompt and it will bring up a list of supported tool names and example parameters.

Once you’ve exported the data you need, you can use CRconvert.exe to convert the data from XML to another file format like CSV or HTML.

Key features:

●	Comes with three modules – directory-listing, active running module, and YARA processing module.
●	Displays application resource information
●	Verifies the digital signature of the process executable.
●	Scans memory, loaded module files, and on-disk files of all currently running processes

![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/27.png)

**Linux ‘dd'**

dd comes by default on the majority of Linux distributions available today (e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora). This tool can be used for various digital forensic tasks such as forensically wiping a drive (zero-ing out a drive) and creating a raw image of a drive.


Key features:

●	Duplicates data across files, devices, partitions, and volumes.
●	Supports master boot record backup and restore.
●	It can modify data easily
●	Needs to be used with caution as it can wipe a disk completely.

Usage:
1)	The basic dd syntax for forensically wiping a drive is:

           dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb1 bs=1024 | where if = input file, of = output file, bs = byte size

2)	The basic dd syntax for creating a forensic image of a drive is:

dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/home/andrew/newimage.dd bs=512 conv=noerror,sync | where if = input file (or in this case drive), of = output file, bs = byte size, conv = conversion options

![](/images/2021-02-13-DFIR2/28.png)
