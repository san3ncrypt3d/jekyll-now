In this blog we will dicuss how someone can setup ZAP proxy in headless mode and export the finding to pdf/Html/Docx.

I will be using OWASP ZAP for scanning and will use a bash script to automate the process of scanning and generating a report with “export-report” add-on and converting the report into PDF and Docx.

Let’s get started:

Pre-requisites:

1)	Install OWASP Zap – [https://www.zaproxy.org/download/ ]( https://www.zaproxy.org/download/)


2)	 Install wkhtmltopdf – ```sudo apt update; sudo apt install wkhtmltopdf```


3)	Install Pandoc – ```sudo apt install pandoc```


I just used wget to install ZAP:

```
wget https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/releases/download/v2.10.0/ZAP_2_10_0_unix.sh
```

Now run the file, and accept the terms and conditions:

After installation you can use the “zap.sh” file to execute commands.

For usage options, run:

```
./zap.sh -h
```

Now we need to install addon in headless mode:
```
./zap.sh -cmd -addoninstall exportreport
```

Now we will create a bash script to scan a webapp with just URL, the bash script can be found in my GitHub:[ https://github.com/san3ncrypt3d/DAST-Scanner-Automation]( https://github.com/san3ncrypt3d/DAST-Scanner-Automation)

```
Git clone https://github.com/san3ncrypt3d/DAST-Scanner-Automation.git
cd DAST-Scanner-Automation/
./scanner.sh {URL}

```

Once the scanner finishes you will get a report in html, pdf and docx.
