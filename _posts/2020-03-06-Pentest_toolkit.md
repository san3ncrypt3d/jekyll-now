title: Script to Automate Installing Pentest Tools
---

When it comes to penetration testing, Kali linux is one of the most preferred operating system. However, some people prefer to use other DEB based systems. There have been time when I was forced to perform pentest on ubuntu, although it comes with almost no tools for pentesting. so, I decided to put together a script that automate installation of some of the tool that you will need to start performing a pentest.

For those who donâ€™t know, Katoolin is a Python script which is used to install all Kali Linux tools at once or manually one by one. However, This is not a tutorial for ##Katoolin.

You can download the script from: [https://github.com/san3ncrypt3d/Pentest_ToolKit](https://github.com/san3ncrypt3d/Pentest_ToolKit) 

The script is very easy to use:

```
$chmod +x pentest_toolkit.sh 
```

```
$./pentest_toolkit.sh
```

The script will first update && upgrade the OS then it will install some of the essential command liners:

```
 make
 curl
 git
 vim
 whois
 gcc
 dnsutils
 python-pip
 python
 python3

```

Other tools installed:

```
nmap
nikto
masscan
massdns
hydra
Sublist3r
Sqlmap
wpscan
dirb
metasploit
```

The script will also pull wordlists from Seclist [https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists) and add it into ~/pentest/wordlists


Feel free to modify the script based on the tools you prefer.

Some of the other tools to add in the future:

```
aquatone
AWSBucketDump
amass
recon-ng

```
