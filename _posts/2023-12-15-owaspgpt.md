## Introduction

OWASPGPT-10 is a tool designed to streamline threat modeling by aligning it with the OWASP Top 10 methodology. The tool generate threats and mitigation based on a description provided by a user. A framework such as OWASP top 10 can be used by organizations to maintain consistency and alignment when mapping vulnerabilities from different sources like penetration testing, dynamic application security testing (DAST) scans and Threat Modelling.


## Benefits of Standardized Threat Modeling

OWASP Top 10 is widely adopted across the security landscape. By aligning threat models with these standards, OWASPGPT-10 offers several advantages:
- **Standardization**: Standardizing threat models enhances consistency and understanding across teams.
- **Efficiency**: Allows easy mapping of identified vulnerabilities to well-defined categories.
- **Integration**: Facilitates integration with existing vulnerability management practices.

## Embracing AI for Threat Modeling

OWASPGPT-10 leverages AI-powered threat modeling, utilizing OpenAI's GPT models. This not only standardizes the process but also minimizes the human bias involved in threat identification. Many organizations have opted to disable ChatGPT to prevent potential misuse, the way OWASPGPT-10 is designed, it limit the  exposure solely to threat modeling, it enables engineers to adopt the tool while mitigating the misuse of AI capabilities.

Additionally, using an AI-powered threat modeler offers several advantages over manual threat generation. First, it significantly reduces time and effort, enabling quicker identification of potential threats and their mitigations. Additionally, AI models continuously learn from vast datasets, staying updated with emerging threats.

Manual threat generation involves extensive human resources, including skilled security analysts. It demands ongoing training and expertise, incurring high labor costs. Conversely, while initial investment might be necessary for AI implementation, long-term costs are comparatively lower, mainly through reduced human labor and scalability
